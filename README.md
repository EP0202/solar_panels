# Data was extracted from a public data source on BigQuery using SQL for initial cleaning. Source: Google Project Sunroof data explorer (August 2017). 
# Python was used for EDA and model building/evaluation - logistic regression. 
# train-test-split, predict_proba, log-odds, confusion_matrix, classification_report, feature importance.   
# note: coding is showing outliers are present in predictor variables but no relevant difference was shown with or without the outliers as the model was tested leaving them, dropping them, and assiging them to 95th percentile & 5th percentile.
# just a project
